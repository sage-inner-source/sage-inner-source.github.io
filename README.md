# sage-inner-source.github.io

This is to generate pages for the GitHub Pages site: https://sage-inner-source.github.io/

It is also possible to visit the GitHub Pages for other repos within this organisation, from the URL above, just by appending the repo name to the URL, for example:
 
 https://sage-inner-source.github.io/enterprise-showcase

However, that example link will redirect to a randomly generated URL with an ending of .pages.github.io - because private (or internal) repos always do this ([read more](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/changing-the-visibility-of-your-github-pages-site#about-subdomains-for-privately-published-sites)) 
Public repos retain the https://sage-inner-source.github.io/ domain.
